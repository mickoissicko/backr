# FAQ
### Help! How do I download this?
You can't actually download this tool directly. You must download it via the [Mix Pkg Manager]("https://github.com/mickoissicko/mixmgr")

### I want to download an older version!
Just append '-v(x.x.x.y.z)' to the end of the package name. Here's how it might look:

`mmgr /get backer` <-- this downloads the latest backer

`mmgr /get backer-v1.0.0.s1` <-- this downloads version 1.0.0 stable 1

`mmgr /get backer-v0.2.5.rc6` <-- this downloads version 0.2.5's 6th RC

...And so on!

# Developer's notice
This project is heavily under development, and so is MMGR.

It could take months for the first stable MMGR version. Backer is going to be developed, and released first.

The binaries will be served through here, but will stop updating after MMGR 1.0 is made available.
